## Other notes

- **IAM is Universal:** It does not apply to regions at this time <br>
- **The Root Account:** This is the account created when you first set up your AWS account and it has complete admin access. Secure it as soon as possible and **do not** use it to login day-to-day.<br>
- **New Users:** New users have no permissions when they are first created<br>
- **Access key ID/Secret access keys:** You cannot use the access key ID and secret access key to login to the console. They are used to access AWS via the API or command line.<br>
- **You only get to view the access key ID and secret access key once.** If you lose them, you need to regenerate them.<br>
- **Password Rotations:** You can create and customize your password rotation policies.<br>
- **IAM Federation:** You can federate your AWS user accounts.<br>
